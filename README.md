# Project-Z - All about Business Intelligence

Project-Z is just a repository of code that combines different open source initiative and makes it easy to run them locally or in a VM (Virtual Machine) using docker. The purpose of this project is educationally.

There are a lot of great open source projects out there, but it might be hard for a novice BI-developer to understand them or even try them out. The goal of this project is to provide a sample of a fully functional BI-platform, using ONLY open source resources!

All learning materials are or will be included in the wiki.
